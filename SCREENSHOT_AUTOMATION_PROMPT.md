**I need to automate the creation of app store screenshots for my React Native/Expo app "My Tackle Box".**

**Requirements:**
- My app is built with React Native/Expo
- I need screenshots for multiple device sizes (iPhone 6.7", 6.5", 5.5", iPad Pro 12.9", etc.)
- I need both screenshots and app preview videos
- I want to automate this process rather than manually taking screenshots for each size

**Current Setup:**
- App runs in Expo Go for development
- Can also create development builds with EAS
- App has multiple screens: Home (Lure Analyzer), TackleBox, Settings, Paywall

**What I need:**
1. A solution to automatically generate all required screenshot sizes from a single set of source images
2. Preferably a free or low-cost tool
3. Instructions on how to set it up and use it
4. If possible, a script or workflow to automate the entire process

**Preferred approach:**
- Use a tool like Appshot, Rotato, or Fastlane
- Or create a script that can resize/crop screenshots to required dimensions
- Should work with both iOS and Android requirements

**Please provide:**
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Recommended tools with pros/cons
- Any code/scripts needed
- How to integrate this into my workflow
