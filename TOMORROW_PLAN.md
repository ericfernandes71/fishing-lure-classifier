# 📅 Tomorrow's Action Plan - MyTackleBox

## 🎯 Primary Goal
**Complete RevenueCat subscription setup and prepare for app store submission**

---

## ⏰ Morning (2-3 hours)

### 1. **Configure RevenueCat Dashboard** 🔴 Priority 1
**Time:** 30-45 minutes  
**Status:** Can do this NOW (no developer account needed)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Log into RevenueCat dashboard (test API key already in code)
- [ ] Create entitlement: `pro`
  - Identifier: `pro`
  - Display name: "MyTackleBox Pro"
- [ ] Create/verify products:
  - `monthly` - Monthly subscription ($4.99)
  - `yearly` - Yearly subscription ($39.99)  
  - `lifetime` - One-time purchase ($49.99)
- [ ] Create offering:
  - Set as default offering
  - Add all 3 packages (monthly, yearly, lifetime)
- [ ] Verify product IDs match code exactly

**Files to check:**
- `FishingLureApp/src/services/subscriptionService.js` - Product IDs

**Expected outcome:** RevenueCat dashboard fully configured, ready to connect stores later

---

### 2. **Test Subscription Flow** 🟡 Priority 2
**Time:** 30-45 minutes  
**Status:** Can test with test API key

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Start development server: `cd FishingLureApp && npm start`
- [ ] Test on device/simulator with Expo Go
- [ ] Test user login (RevenueCat should auto-initialize)
- [ ] Navigate to paywall screen
- [ ] Verify packages load correctly
- [ ] Test purchase flow (will use sandbox/test environment)
- [ ] Test restore purchases
- [ ] Check subscription status updates correctly

**What to verify:**
- ✅ RevenueCat initializes on login (check console logs)
- ✅ Paywall shows available packages
- ✅ Purchase flow works (even if test purchase)
- ✅ Subscription status is checked correctly
- ✅ Quota system works (free tier vs PRO)

**Note:** Actual purchases won't work until stores are connected, but the flow should work

## ☕ Mid-Day (1-2 hours)

### 3. **Developer Account Decision** 🔴 Priority 3
**Time:** Decision + setup time  
**Status:** Required before production builds

**Decide:**
- [ ] **Option A:** Get Apple Developer Program ($99/year) + Google Play Console ($25)
  - Total: $124 first year
  - Can build production apps immediately
  - Timeline: Apple approval 1-2 days, Google instant
  
- [ ] **Option B:** Start with Android only ($25)
  - Cheaper entry point
  - Test on Google Play first
  - Add iOS later

- [ ] **Option C:** Wait until ready to launch
  - Continue development/testing
  - Get accounts when ready to submit

**Recommendation:** Option B (start with Android) - lower cost, instant approval, test the full process

**If proceeding:**
- [ ] Sign up for Google Play Console ($25)
- [ ] Create app listing in Google Play Console
- [ ] (If going with Apple too) Sign up for Apple Developer Program ($99)
